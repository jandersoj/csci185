    <!-- okay so it would be fairly easy to just make individual cards with their own images and text and then format them.
    but also like. I could steal those fun little loops we did to make some but im not Quite sure how one would go about that even though she already showed us how
    let's try to make a sample card i think woul d be the way to go? and do a nice basic site layout thing -->

    <!-- haha nvm ive done it wih the loop average josie w, for now i think i can leave it unedr CSCI and i think itll be ok -->

    <!-- update: i am making this the info page and moving the cards to other saints for now-->
